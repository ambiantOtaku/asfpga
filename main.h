/*
asfpga version 1.00e
====================
asfpga is an assembler written for use in FPGA design. It can be easily modified
for your instruction set. The ultimate goal of this software is to allow
a FPGA designer to easily write assembly code for a custom instruction set.

The current version allows to create a listing file, a memory dump file which can be used in debugging HDL code using $readmemh() or equivalent routine, and a binary file which can be used to program a EPROM.
